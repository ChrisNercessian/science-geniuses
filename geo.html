        As you see at the beginning of the page,
        the world has 7 continents. Each continent has a lot of 
        countries in it. Each country has its capital.
        For example, I live in Canada. Canada's capital is Ottawa.
        I live in Montreal which is located in the province of Quebec.
        Some countries have provinces that have their own capital.
        Quebec's capital is Quebec city.
